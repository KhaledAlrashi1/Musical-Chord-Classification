# Musical-Chord-Classification
### The project aims to classify chords in audio files (generated by piano and guitar) into major or minor categories. It utilizes methods that analyze frequency-domain (visible spikes in frequency) characteristics of notes. We explore various data processing techniques to highlight features that distinguish between chord types. The extracted feature sets are then processed through several machine learning approaches, ranging from traditional ML approaches to complex deep learning architectures. We see that traditional approaches are still very significant in a problem such as this, especially due to the lack of availability of training data to train deeper models.
